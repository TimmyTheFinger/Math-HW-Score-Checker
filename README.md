# Math-HW-Score-Checker
First test repository. Just wanted to see how all of this works so I know how to do this in the future. 

I made this program since my calc teacher inputs the HW score and the end ofthe semester and the website we use (cengage) wouldn't give me a current grade. 

How to use: 

Super simple, just open the .csv file and follow the format I provided. Then run the python program in any IDE. Make sure you have [pandas]([url](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html)https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html) library installed.
